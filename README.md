# UI-Interview

Chat application
Requirement:
Build a chat application for country flags. If we ask the country name 
should display the respective flags. You can use any Mock apiâ€™s / data. 
Feel free to use any CSS frameworks but ensure the application should be 
in reactjs. You can refer the UI visuals from the attachment video.

Expectations:
1. Ask questions to explore and understand the system.
2. Create a chat bot only for country flags.
3. Chat component should be responsive.
4. Chat should work for all the countries.
5. Chat responses should follow 3x3 layout. (Should be configurable)
6. Use clean code, meaningful method names, classes and variables
7. Implement a clean and extensible solution with SOLID, 
oops/functional principles
8. Don't look up implementations online as that defeats the trust and 
intent of the interview.
9. Bonus for error handling and unit tests

There will be an extension round, where we will pair online and add 
extension to the above problem.
